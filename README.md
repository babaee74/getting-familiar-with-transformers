# Getting familiar with transformers in pytorch

This is a pytorch implementation of transformers and I have trained it on number place value dataset and algebra dataset. for prediction I have used greedy search. for dataset preparation I have used torchtext TranslationDataset and split the data in my folder to train and test and then used an Iterator as data loader. for advanced usage you can use Hugginface transformer models.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `Open the given notebook on Google Colab or Your Local System` [https://github.com/babaee74/radar-road-segmenation-dataset](https://github.com/babaee74/getting-familiar-with-transformers)
